Hello there! :smile:	:wave:

My Name is Daniel Yaghoobian and I am a full stack software developer. I have been interested in technology from early childhood and have attended General Assembly's full stack program. In addition to my fascination with technology, my knowledge extends to finance where I started banking at the age of 17 and managed all credit for a online lending platform.
